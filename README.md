# The Game

This is the best game

## Installation

We use [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to manage environments.

```bash
conda env create
```

Activate the environment using miniconda:

```bash
conda activate TheGame
```

Install [KivEnt](http://kivent.org/) (ensure this is done inside your virtual environment). I've only tested this on Mac, YMMV for other OSes.

```bash
./kivent-install.sh
```

## Run

Do the thing!

```bash
python main.py
```
